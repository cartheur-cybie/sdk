RSC-300 Chip interface
======================

This note describes the interface to the RSC-300 CPU in ICybie's
head, used for voice recognition.

The RSC-300 CPU has 1KB of E2PROM for storing recorded voice commands.

The interface to the RSC-300 uses 16 bits of data to and from the
main Toshiba CPU, using the same format as the standard IR protocol
(but not sent through the IR transmitters).

This makes the RSC-300 control intimately tied to the IR logic.

For more details, see the source code to the ICLib2 (ICybie Library)
In particular:
	ir1.c - for low-level IR
	ir2.c - for mid-level IR
    voice.c - for voice training and other functions

    or put in ircodes.txt ??? (or put a reference from ircodes.txt to here)
