E2PROM - Storage
================

This note gives a quick overview of the E2PROM used to store ICybie settings.

Please refer to specs for the 93LC46 E2PROM chip if you want more details
on the actual chip.

NOTE: the 93LC46 E2PROM chips is attached to the motherboard
and is used by the main Toshiba CPU to store 64 words (128 bytes)
of settings data. There is an additional 1024 bytes of E2PROM
used by the voice recognition CPU (RSC-300) to store voice commands.

For more details, see the source code to the ICLib2 (ICybie Library)
In particular:
	storage.c - for E2PROM access

======================================================================

Ports (see ports.txt)
	P5.3: (O) E2PROM Storage (CS of 93LC46)
	P5.4: (O) E2PROM Storage (CLK of 93LC46)
	P5.5: (O) E2PROM Storage (DI of 93LC46)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

9 bit command word:

        110aaaaaa - read storage
        101aaaaaa dddddddd dddddddd - storage write
        100aaaaaa 
        See 93LC46 specs for more details
    
==========================================================
Standard E2PROM storage usage:

see "ic_storage.h"
Be VERY careful if you want to store your own data in E2PROM
since you can totally screw up the regular ICybie personality.

Last mode/mood is stored in E2PROM
	Moods:
	    0 = Hyper
	    1 = Happy
	    2 = Sleepy
	    3 = Sad
	    4 = Sick
	    5 = n/a
	    6 = Guard mode (special)

'Use Voice Commands' (10, 7, Large) is stored in E2PROM

'Battery Low' is stored in E2PROM

'Stay Mode' is not stored in E2PROM (guard or Remote 7)

Auto Listen (10, 5, Large) is not stored in E2PROM (starts off)

For walkup charger:
    Enable look for station (10, 9, Large, 3, Large) is not stored in E2PROM
