SunPlus Chip interface
======================

This note describes the interface to the SunPlus daughter CPU
used for sound playback, LED control and extra sensor input bits.

The SunPlus chip is a small 8 bit microprocessor connected to
the main Toshiba CPU with a simple 2 data bit serial protocol.

This protocol is very inefficient, and requires a lot of CPU
overhead to use (ie. during sound playback).

For more details, see the source code to the ICLib2 (ICybie Library)
In particular:
	sound.c - for LED/sound playback
    sensor.c - for sensor polling

======================================================================

Ports (see ports.txt)

	PD.5: (O) protocol to SunPlus daughter CPU (clock)
	PD.6: (O) protocol to SunPlus daughter CPU (data)
	PD.7: (O) protocol to SunPlus daughter CPU (data)

	P9.4: (I) SunPlus daughter CPU ack/data

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2 bit serial protocol:
    PD.7 + PD.6 = 2 data bits (interleaved nibbles)
    PD.5 = clock (high to send)
        P9.4 = acknowledged

    (see source for more details)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands to daughter board:

    $10 - start of PCM4 data

    $20 - LEDs
    $25
    $26
    $2A
    $2B
    $2F

    $40 - shutdown

    $30 - poll inputs (return 10 bits)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

10 bit input from daughter board:
    bInput1:bInput0

bInputs0
    .0 = Tilt Back (1 = on his back, upside-down)
    .1 = Nose (1 = open, 0 = hand)
    .2 = Tilt Butt (1 = fell on butt)
    .3 = Head pat sensor (1 = pressed)
    .4 = Battery door (1 = closed)
    .5 = Tilt Right (1 = on R side)
    .6 = Tilt Left (1 = on L side)
    .7 = ? (mystery sensor)

bInput1
    .0 = Back sensor (1 = pressed)
    .1 = Tilt Face (1 = fell on face)
