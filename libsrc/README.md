## Notes for the libsrc code

Read the "OVERVIEW" at the top of each source file and read any related "NOTES\*.TXT" files.
* Items marked with "REVIEW" are items needing fixing before a real ICSDK release is made.
* Items marked with "LATER" need work, but can wait until later.
* See ..\README.TXT for general list of project status

### Files in this folder

* icpriv.h - header for library components, general private stuff.
* ircodes.h - some IR codes.

_Source files_ | Features are layered

* Core runtime:
    - crt3.asm - startup code forces linkage of start.c
	- start.c - main startup
	- init1.c - peripheral init
	- assert.c - support for "ic_assert" macro
	- shutdown.c - shut down
    - main0.c - standard init (pulls in everything else)

* Limited C runtime: (implementations are lame, but small in size)
	- printf.c
	- memcpy.c
	- memset.c
	- rand.c
    - ldivl.asm, lmull.asm
        - compiler helpers for long math

* Hardware Subsystems: (independent of most other things)
	- serial.c - serial port (requires a "Super ICybie")
	- storage.c - EEPROM storage
	- flash.c - writing to flash ROM
    - timer.c - general purpose timers
	- adc.c - A->D converter (for legs, light and battery level)
	- ir1.c - IR modulation (includes voice chip communication)
    - sensor.c - sensor inputs
    - sound.c - sound playback (and LED eyes)
	- motor.c - PWM motor control (legs + head + neck + mouth + tail)

* Higher Levels built on Hardware Subsystems
    - ir2.c - IR command interpretation
    - leg1.c - leg movement
	- leg2.c - scaled leg movement (needed for motions)
	- leg3.c - re-calibration of legs (NYI)
    - motion.c - motion playback (needed for actions)
	- posture.c - posture control (needed for actions)
	- action.c - action playback

* System ROM glue
	- sysrom.c - glue to system ROM
    - motion2.c - standard numbered motions (most of data is in system ROM)
    - action2*.c - generated files containing the 200+ standard actions

### To Review

* Add block diagram.
* Add comparison to System ROM implementations.

### Build the sources

* `m` = m.bat = build
* `m clean` = remove temp files
